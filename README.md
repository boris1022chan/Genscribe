### Summary of proposal:

No one wants to be the note taker at a meeting, or sit through an hour-long recording just to find a couple quips of information. That’s why we’re building Genscribe to take notes for you. It can be used in any context (Skype/ Call/ GoToMeeting/ In-person meeting). Genscribe gives a short summary of the meeting outlining the key topics discussed, upcoming deadlines, dates for any other meetings that were scheduled, and important decisions that were made. Since it will be built off a neural network model, it can also be extended to summarize other interactions, such as calls or emails.
